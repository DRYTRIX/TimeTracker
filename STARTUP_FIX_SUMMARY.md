# Startup Error Fix - Summary

## Problem Fixed

The application was failing to start with this error:
```
RuntimeError: Working outside of application context
```

This occurred because `stripe_service` was trying to access `current_app.config` at module import time (when the module is loaded), but Flask's `current_app` is only available within an application context.

## What Was Fixed

### File: `app/utils/stripe_service.py`

**Changed the initialization pattern from:**
```python
class StripeService:
    def __init__(self):
        # ❌ This tries to access current_app at import time
        self.api_key = current_app.config.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
        if self.api_key:
            stripe.api_key = self.api_key
```

**To lazy initialization:**
```python
class StripeService:
    def __init__(self):
        # ✅ Just set flags, don't access current_app yet
        self._api_key = None
        self._initialized = False
    
    def _ensure_initialized(self):
        # ✅ Access current_app only when methods are called
        if not self._initialized:
            try:
                self._api_key = current_app.config.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
                if self._api_key:
                    stripe.api_key = self._api_key
                self._initialized = True
            except RuntimeError:
                pass
```

**Added `self._ensure_initialized()` to all methods** that interact with Stripe API or config.

## Why This Works

1. **Module Import**: When Python imports the module, `StripeService()` is instantiated, but it no longer accesses `current_app`
2. **Method Calls**: When you actually call a method like `stripe_service.create_customer()`, it's within a request context
3. **Lazy Loading**: The `_ensure_initialized()` method only runs the first time a method is called, when `current_app` is available

## Files Modified

- ✅ `app/utils/stripe_service.py` - Fixed lazy initialization

## Next Steps

The application should now start successfully. You can now:

1. **Start the application**: The startup error should be resolved
2. **Run migrations**: Apply the authentication system migrations
3. **Test Stripe integration**: When Stripe is configured, it will initialize on first use

## Verification

To verify the fix worked:

```bash
# Application should start without errors
flask run

# Or in Docker
docker-compose up
```

You should see the app start successfully without the `RuntimeError`.

## Migration Fix Still Needed

Don't forget you also need to fix the migration chain. See:
- `MIGRATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Quick overview
- `MIGRATION_FIX.md` - Detailed guide
- `fix_migration_chain.py` - Automated fix script

Run one of these after the app starts:
```bash
# Option 1: Auto-fix
python fix_migration_chain.py
flask db upgrade

# Option 2: Manual stamp
flask db stamp 018
flask db upgrade
```

## Pattern for Future Services

If you create other services that need Flask config, use this pattern:

```python
class MyService:
    def __init__(self):
        # Don't access current_app here
        self._initialized = False
    
    def _ensure_initialized(self):
        # Access current_app when first method is called
        if not self._initialized:
            try:
                self._config = current_app.config.get('MY_CONFIG')
                self._initialized = True
            except RuntimeError:
                pass
    
    def my_method(self):
        self._ensure_initialized()  # Call this first
        # ... rest of method
```

## Summary

- ✅ Fixed `StripeService` initialization
- ✅ Application can now start
- ⏳ Migration fix still needed (see other docs)
- ✅ Pattern documented for future services

The authentication system is complete and ready to use once migrations are applied!
