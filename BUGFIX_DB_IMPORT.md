# üêõ Bug Fix: Import Errors in Route Files

## Issues

### Issue 1: Import Error for 'db'

**Error**:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'db' from 'app.models'
```

**Cause**: Two route files were trying to import `db` from `app.models`, but `db` is defined in `app/__init__.py`, not in the models module.

### Issue 2: Missing Module 'db_helpers'

**Error**:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.utils.db_helpers'
```

**Cause**: Two route files were trying to import from `app.utils.db_helpers`, but the module is actually named `app.utils.db`.

## üîß Fixes Applied

### Changed Files (2)

#### 1. `app/routes/time_entry_templates.py`

**Fix 1 - Wrong db import source:**
```python
# Before (WRONG)
from app.models import TimeEntryTemplate, Project, Task, db

# After (CORRECT)
from app import db
from app.models import TimeEntryTemplate, Project, Task
```

**Fix 2 - Wrong module name for safe_commit:**
```python
# Before (WRONG)
from app.utils.db_helpers import safe_commit

# After (CORRECT)
from app.utils.db import safe_commit
```

#### 2. `app/routes/saved_filters.py`

**Fix 1 - Wrong db import source:**
```python
# Before (WRONG)
from app.models import SavedFilter, db

# After (CORRECT)
from app import db
from app.models import SavedFilter
```

**Fix 2 - Wrong module name for safe_commit:**
```python
# Before (WRONG)
from app.utils.db_helpers import safe_commit

# After (CORRECT)
from app.utils.db import safe_commit
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

```bash
python -m py_compile app/routes/time_entry_templates.py
python -m py_compile app/routes/saved_filters.py

‚úÖ Both files compile successfully
```

## üìù Notes

### Correct Import Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Database Instance (`db`)

In Flask-SQLAlchemy applications, the `db` object should always be imported from the main app module:

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT
from app import db
from app.models import SomeModel

# ‚ùå WRONG
from app.models import SomeModel, db
```

This is because:
1. `db` is created in `app/__init__.py`
2. Models import `db` from `app` to define themselves
3. Trying to import `db` from `app.models` creates a circular dependency issue

#### Pattern 2: Utility Functions

Always verify the actual module name before importing utilities:

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Check what exists in app/utils/
from app.utils.db import safe_commit

# ‚ùå WRONG - Assuming a module name
from app.utils.db_helpers import safe_commit
```

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy

The application should now start successfully. Run:

```bash
docker-compose restart app
```
