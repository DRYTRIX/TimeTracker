### HackerNews "Show HN"

**Title:** Show HN: TimeTracker – Open-source time tracking with optional hosted SaaS

**Post:**
```
Hi HN,

I built TimeTracker, an open-source time tracking application that you can 
self-host for free or use as a hosted service.

GitHub: https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker
Demo: https://demo.timetracker.com
Hosted: https://timetracker.com

The problem I wanted to solve: Most time tracking tools are either too simple 
(just a timer) or too complex (enterprise features you don't need). I wanted 
something in the middle—powerful enough for client billing and invoicing, but 
simple enough to use daily without friction.

Key features:
- Smart time tracking with idle detection
- Client and project management
- Professional PDF invoices with customizable templates
- Comprehensive reports and analytics
- Multi-user support with role-based access
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- Docker deployment with automatic database migrations

Tech stack:
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL (also supports SQLite)
- Frontend: Bootstrap + vanilla JS (no heavy frameworks)
- Deployment: Docker + Docker Compose
- Billing: Stripe integration for hosted offering

The hosted version costs €5/month for single user or €6/user/month for teams, 
with a 14-day free trial. But the entire codebase is GPL-3.0 licensed, so you 
can self-host for free with all features included.

I'd love feedback on:
1. The pricing model (too high/low? fair split between hosted/self-hosted?)
2. Missing features you'd want in a time tracker
3. The technical implementation (any glaring issues?)

Happy to answer questions!
```

### Reddit r/selfhosted

**Title:** TimeTracker - Open source time tracking with professional invoicing [Docker, PostgreSQL]

**Post:**
```
Hey r/selfhosted!

I've been working on TimeTracker, an open-source time tracking application 
designed for freelancers and teams. It's fully self-hostable with Docker.

**What it does:**
- Track time automatically or manually
- Organize by clients, projects, and tasks
- Generate professional PDF invoices
- Beautiful reports and analytics
- Multi-user with role-based permissions

**Why I built it:**
I freelance and needed something more than a basic timer but less than 
enterprise tools like Jira. Most SaaS time trackers felt bloated, locked 
my data away, or charged too much. So I built this.

**Self-hosting details:**
- Docker + Docker Compose (one command to deploy)
- PostgreSQL or SQLite
- Automatic database migrations
- Nginx/Caddy reverse proxy support
- Resource efficient (runs great on a Raspberry Pi)
- Full documentation and deployment guides

**Tech stack:**
- Flask (Python) backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Bootstrap + vanilla JS frontend
- No heavy frameworks or build steps

**License:** GPL-3.0 (free forever, all features)

**Optional hosted service:**
If you don't want to self-host, I also offer a hosted version at €5-6/user/month 
with automatic backups, updates, and support. But self-hosting is completely 
free with no feature restrictions.

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker
- Demo: https://demo.timetracker.com
- Docs: https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker/tree/main/docs

Would love feedback from the community! What features would you want to see?
