#~ msgid "What happens if I forget to stop my timer?"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The timer will continue running until"
#~ " you stop it manually. You can "
#~ "see your active timer on the "
#~ "dashboard and timer page. The timer "
#~ "persists even if you close your "
#~ "browser or restart your device. If "
#~ "idle detection is enabled, the timer "
#~ "may pause automatically after the "
#~ "configured timeout period."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Can I edit time entries after they're created?"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Yes, you can edit any time entry"
#~ " by clicking the edit button in "
#~ "the time entry list. You can "
#~ "modify the project, start/end times, "
#~ "notes, tags, billable status, and task"
#~ " assignment. Admins can edit all time"
#~ " entries, while regular users can "
#~ "only edit their own entries."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "How do I track time for multiple projects?"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "By default, you can only have one"
#~ " active timer at a time. To "
#~ "switch projects, stop your current timer"
#~ " and start a new one for the"
#~ " different project. Alternatively, you can"
#~ " create manual time entries for past"
#~ " work or configure the system to "
#~ "allow multiple active timers (admin "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "How do I export my time data?"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Go to the Reports page and use "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "What's the difference between billable and non-billable time?"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Billable time is tracked for client "

#~ "hourly rate associated with it. Non-"
#~ "billable time is for internal work "
#~ "that doesn't get charged to clients. "
#~ "You can mark individual time entries "
#~ "as billable or non-billable, and "
#~ "projects can have default billable "
#~ "settings. This distinction is crucial "
#~ "for accurate invoicing and profitability "
#~ "analysis."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "How do I create an invoice from my time entries?"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Navigate to Invoices → Create Invoice,"

#~ " Entries\" to automatically create invoice"
#~ " items from your tracked time. You"

#~ msgid "How do I create bulk time entries for multiple days?"

#~ "Navigate to Work → Bulk Time "
#~ "Entry. Select your project, choose a "
