## 🗑️ Removed Workflows

### What Was Removed

| Workflow | Removed | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `ci.yml` | ✅ Deleted | Fully replaced by `ci-comprehensive.yml` |
| `docker-publish.yml` | ✅ Deleted | Fully replaced by `cd-development.yml` & `cd-release.yml` |

### Where Functionality Went

**From `ci.yml`:**
- Migration testing → `ci-comprehensive.yml` (database tests)
- Docker build testing → `ci-comprehensive.yml` (Docker job)
- Basic security → `ci-comprehensive.yml` (security tests)

**From `docker-publish.yml`:**
- Development builds → `cd-development.yml`
- Production builds → `cd-release.yml`
- Image tagging → Both CD workflows
- Multi-platform → Both CD workflows

### Backups Available

Backup copies saved in:
```
.github/workflows-archive/
├── ci.yml.backup
└── docker-publish.yml.backup
```

## 🎯 How Workflows Trigger

### Pull Request Scenario

```
Developer creates PR
  ↓
✅ ci-comprehensive.yml runs (always)
✅ static.yml runs (always)
✅ migration-check.yml runs (if models changed)
  ↓
Results posted to PR
  ↓
All checks must pass to merge
```

### Development Build Scenario

```
Push to develop branch
  ↓
✅ ci-comprehensive.yml runs (testing)
✅ cd-development.yml runs (build & publish)
  ↓
Development image available
  ↓
Ready to deploy to dev environment
```

### Production Release Scenario

```
Push to main or create tag v1.2.3
  ↓
✅ cd-release.yml runs (full pipeline)
  ↓
Full test suite passes
  ↓
Multi-platform images built
  ↓
Published to GHCR
  ↓
GitHub release created
  ↓
Production ready
```
