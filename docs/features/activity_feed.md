| `created` | Entity was created | Projects, Tasks, Clients, Invoices |
| `updated` | Entity was modified | Projects, Tasks, Time Entries |
| `deleted` | Entity was removed | Projects, Tasks, Time Entries |
| `started` | Timer started | Time Entries |
| `stopped` | Timer stopped | Time Entries |
| `completed` | Task marked as done | Tasks |
| `assigned` | Task assigned to user | Tasks |

| `unarchived` | Entity unarchived | Projects |

## Entity Types

Activities can be tracked for the following entity types:

- `project` - Project management
- `task` - Task operations
- `time_entry` - Time tracking
- `invoice` - Invoicing
- `client` - Client management
- `user` - User administration (admin only)
- `comment` - Comments and discussions

## Integration Guide

### For Developers

To add activity logging to new features, use the `Activity.log()` method:

```python
from app.models import Activity

Activity.log(
    user_id=current_user.id,
    action='created',  # Action type
    entity_type='project',  # Entity type
    entity_id=project.id,
    entity_name=project.name,
    description=f'Created project "{project.name}"',
    extra_data={'client_id': client.id},  # Optional metadata
    ip_address=request.remote_addr,  # Optional
    user_agent=request.headers.get('User-Agent')  # Optional
)
```

**Best Practices:**

1. **Always log after successful operations** - Log after the database commit succeeds
2. **Provide clear descriptions** - Make descriptions human-readable
3. **Include relevant metadata** - Use `extra_data` for additional context
4. **Store entity names** - Cache the entity name in case it's deleted later
5. **Handle failures gracefully** - Activity logging includes built-in error handling

### Already Integrated

Activity logging is already integrated for:
- ‚úÖ Projects (create, update, delete, archive, unarchive)
- ‚úÖ Tasks (create, update, delete, status changes, assignments)
- ‚úÖ Time Entries (start timer, stop timer, manual create, edit, delete)
- ‚è≥ Invoices (create, update, status change, payment, send) - *coming soon*
- ‚è≥ Clients (create, update, delete) - *coming soon*
- ‚è≥ Comments (create) - *coming soon*

## Use Cases

### Team Visibility
- See what your team members are working on
- Track project progress in real-time
- Understand team activity patterns

### Audit Trail
- Compliance and record-keeping
- Track who made what changes and when
- Identify suspicious or unusual activity

### Project Management
- Monitor task completion rates
- Track project milestones
- Review team productivity

### Troubleshooting
- Investigate issues by reviewing recent changes
- Identify when problems were introduced
- Track down missing or deleted items

## Configuration

No special configuration is required. The Activity Feed is enabled by default for all users.

### Database Indexes

The Activity model includes optimized indexes for:
- User-based queries (`user_id`, `created_at`)
- Entity lookups (`entity_type`, `entity_id`)
- Date range queries (`created_at`)

### Performance

- Activities are paginated to prevent slow page loads
- Old activities are automatically retained (no automatic cleanup)
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
- Widget auto-refreshes are throttled to every 30 seconds

## Privacy & Security

### Data Retention
- Activities are stored indefinitely by default
- Administrators can manually delete old activities if needed
- Consider implementing a retention policy for compliance

### Access Control
- Users can only see their own activities (unless admin)
- Administrators see all activities system-wide
- Activity logs cannot be edited or tampered with
- IP addresses and user agents are stored for security auditing

### GDPR Compliance
When a user requests data deletion:
1. Their activities are preserved for audit purposes
2. User information can be anonymized
3. Activities show "Deleted User" for anonymized accounts

## Troubleshooting

### Activities not appearing?

1. **Check permissions** - Regular users only see their own activities
2. **Verify integration** - Ensure the route has Activity.log() calls
3. **Database issues** - Check logs for database errors
4. **Browser cache** - Clear cache or hard refresh the dashboard

### Widget not loading?

1. **Check API endpoint** - Visit `/api/activities` directly
2. **JavaScript errors** - Check browser console for errors
3. **Authentication** - Ensure user is logged in
4. **Network issues** - Check network tab in dev tools

### Missing activities for certain actions?

Some features may not have activity logging integrated yet. Check the "Already Integrated" section above.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Export activities to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Email notifications for specific activities
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Activity feed for specific projects/tasks
