# Project Costs Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive project costs tracking feature that allows tracking expenses beyond hourly work, including travel, materials, services, equipment, and other project-related costs.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Layer
**New Model: `ProjectCost`** (`app/models/project_cost.py`)
- Complete CRUD model for tracking project expenses
- Support for multiple cost categories
- Billable/non-billable tracking
- Invoice integration with invoiced status tracking
- Currency support (EUR, USD, GBP, CHF)
- Receipt path field for future file upload support

**Model Relationships:**
- Updated `Project` model with `costs` relationship
- Updated `User` model with `project_costs` relationship
- Added properties to `Project`: `total_costs`, `total_billable_costs`, `total_project_value`

### 2. Backend Routes
**New Routes in `app/routes/projects.py`:**
- `GET /projects/<id>/costs` - List all costs with filtering
- `GET /projects/<id>/costs/add` - Add cost form
- `POST /projects/<id>/costs/add` - Create new cost
- `GET /projects/<id>/costs/<cost_id>/edit` - Edit cost form
- `POST /projects/<id>/costs/<cost_id>/edit` - Update cost
- `POST /projects/<id>/costs/<cost_id>/delete` - Delete cost
- `GET /api/projects/<id>/costs` - JSON API for costs

**Updated Invoice Generation (`app/routes/invoices.py`):**
- Modified `generate_from_time()` to include project costs
- Automatic marking of costs as invoiced
- Prevention of double-billing invoiced costs
- Support for mixed time entries and costs in invoices

**Updated Reports (`app/routes/reports.py`):**
- Project reports now include cost calculations
- Summary totals include costs
- Category breakdown for costs

### 3. Frontend Templates

**New Templates:**
- `templates/projects/add_cost.html` - Form for adding costs
- `templates/projects/edit_cost.html` - Form for editing costs

**Updated Templates:**

  - Cost summary cards (Total Costs, Billable Costs, Total Project Value)
  - Recent costs table (latest 5)
  - Add/Edit/Delete actions
  - Delete confirmation modal
  - Updated statistics to show costs

### 4. Database Migrations

**Three Migration Options Provided:**

1. **Alembic Migration** (`migrations/versions/018_add_project_costs_table.py`)
   - Standard Python-based migration
   - Revision: 018, follows existing migration chain

2. Click "Generate from Time Entries"
3. Select time entries AND costs to include
4. Click "Generate Items"
5. Review the invoice with both hours and costs as line items

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE project_costs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    description VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    currency_code VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'EUR',
    billable BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    invoiced BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    invoice_id INTEGER REFERENCES invoices(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    cost_date DATE NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    receipt_path VARCHAR(500),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Key Methods

**ProjectCost Model:**
- `get_project_costs(project_id, start_date, end_date, user_id, billable_only)` - Query costs
- `get_total_costs(project_id, ...)` - Calculate total costs
- `get_uninvoiced_costs(project_id)` - Get billable uninvoiced costs
- `get_costs_by_category(project_id, ...)` - Group costs by category
- `mark_as_invoiced(invoice_id)` - Mark cost as invoiced
- `to_dict()` - Convert to dictionary for API

**Project Model:**
- `total_costs` - Property for total project costs
- `total_billable_costs` - Property for billable costs
- `total_project_value` - Property for total value (hours + costs)

## API Endpoints

### Get Project Costs (JSON)
```
GET /api/projects/<project_id>/costs?start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-12-31
```

Response:
```json
{
  "costs": [...],
  "total_costs": 1500.00,
  "billable_costs": 1200.00,
  "count": 5
}
```

## Design Considerations

### Light Look and Feel
Following the TimeTracker design guidelines:
- Clean, modern interface with subtle shadows
- Light color palette with blue accents
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive design for mobile
- Intuitive icons (Font Awesome)
- Consistent with existing UI patterns

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- CASCADE deletion when parent project/user deleted
- SET NULL when invoice deleted (preserve cost history)
- Invoiced costs cannot be deleted
- Transaction-based operations with rollback

### Performance
- Indexed columns: project_id, user_id, cost_date, invoice_id
- Efficient queries using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Lazy loading for relationships
- Optimized aggregation queries

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create a cost on a project
- [x] Edit a cost (as creator)
- [x] Delete a cost (uninvoiced)
- [x] Verify costs appear in project statistics
- [x] Include costs in invoice generation
- [x] Verify costs appear in project reports
- [x] Verify invoiced costs cannot be deleted
- [x] Test permission restrictions (non-creator, non-admin)
- [x] Verify total project value calculation
- [x] Test date filtering on costs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **Receipt Uploads** - File upload for receipts with preview
2. **Cost Approval Workflow** - Multi-level approval for costs
3. **Cost Budgets** - Separate budget tracking for costs
4. **Advanced Analytics** - Charts and visualizations for cost trends
5. **Recurring Costs** - Template for recurring project costs
6. **Currency Conversion** - Automatic conversion with exchange rates
7. **Cost Export** - CSV/PDF export of costs
8. **Cost Categories Management** - Admin panel to manage categories
9. **Cost Alerts** - Notifications for cost thresholds
10. **Cost Comparison** - Compare costs across projects

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Migration fails with "table already exists"**
- Solution: The table already exists from a previous migration. Skip the migration or check if it was partially applied.

**Issue: Costs don't appear in project view**
- Solution: Ensure you've restarted the application after applying migrations. Clear browser cache if needed.

**Issue: Cannot delete a cost**
- Solution: Check if the cost has been invoiced. Invoiced costs cannot be deleted to maintain invoice integrity.

**Issue: Costs not showing in reports**
- Solution: Verify the date range filter includes the cost dates. Check that the project filter includes the project with costs.

### Logs
Check application logs for detailed error messages:
- `logs/timetracker.log` - Application logs
- `logs/timetracker_startup.log` - Startup logs

## Compatibility

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 9.6+
- **Python**: 3.7+
- **Flask**: Compatible with current TimeTracker version
- **SQLAlchemy**: Compatible with current TimeTracker version
- **Browsers**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Security Considerations

- All routes require authentication (`@login_required`)
- Permission checks for edit/delete operations
- SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM
- Input validation on all forms
- CSRF protection via Flask forms
- XSS prevention via Jinja2 autoescaping

## Performance Impact

- Minimal impact on existing features
- Additional queries only on project/invoice/report pages
- Indexed columns for optimal query performance
- Lazy loading prevents unnecessary data fetching
- Caching opportunities for future optimization

## Conclusion

The Project Costs feature is fully implemented and ready for use. It seamlessly integrates with existing TimeTracker functionality while maintaining the clean, light design aesthetic. The feature adds significant value by enabling complete project cost tracking beyond just hourly work.

All database migrations, backend logic, frontend templates, and documentation have been completed. The implementation follows best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
