# Client Notes Feature

## Overview

The **Client Notes** feature allows you to add internal notes about your clients. These notes are completely private and only visible to your team, not to clients. This is perfect for tracking important client information, preferences, special requirements, or any other internal details you need to remember.

|---------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | Integer   | Primary key                              |
| `content`     | Text      | Note content (required)                  |
| `client_id`   | Integer   | Foreign key to `clients.id` (required)   |
| `user_id`     | Integer   | Foreign key to `users.id` (required)     |

| `updated_at`  | DateTime  | Last update timestamp                    |

**Indexes:**
- `ix_client_notes_client_id` on `client_id`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Notes Section Not Visible

**Problem:** The Internal Notes section doesn't appear on the client page.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you've run the latest database migration
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify the user has permission to view clients

### Cannot Edit Notes

**Problem:** Edit button is missing or doesn't work.

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're logged in
2. Check that you're either the note's author or an administrator
3. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser

### API Endpoints Return 404

**Problem:** API calls to note endpoints fail with 404.

**Solution:**
1. Verify the application has been restarted after update
2. Check that the `client_notes_bp` blueprint is registered in `app/__init__.py`
3. Review application logs for import errors

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Descriptive
Write clear, detailed notes that will be helpful months from now. Include:
- Context and background
- Specific dates if relevant
- Names of people involved
- Action items or follow-ups

### 2. Use Important Flag Wisely
Reserve the "important" flag for truly critical information:
- Legal or compliance requirements
- Financial terms and conditions
- Critical preferences or restrictions
- Emergency contact information

### 3. Keep Notes Updated
- Review and update notes periodically
- Archive or delete outdated information
- Add new notes when circumstances change

### 4. Maintain Professionalism
Remember that notes are:
- Potentially subject to legal discovery
- May be seen by other team members
- Part of your business records

Always write notes professionally and factually.

### 5. Use Notes for Team Communication
Notes are a great way to share knowledge:
- Document client quirks or preferences
- Share insights from client meetings
- Provide context for new team members
- Record decisions and their rationale
