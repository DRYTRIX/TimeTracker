# Avatar Persistence Update - Summary

## Quick Summary

✅ **Profile pictures now persist between Docker updates!**

User avatars are now stored in the persistent `/data` volume instead of the application directory, ensuring they survive container rebuilds and updates.

## What to Do

### For Existing Installations

If you have users with existing profile pictures:

```bash
# 1. Stop containers
docker-compose down

# 2. Run migration
docker-compose run --rm app python /app/docker/migrate-avatar-storage.py

# 3. Start containers
docker-compose up -d
```

### For Fresh Installations

Nothing! The new location will be used automatically.

## Changes Made

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| **Storage Location** | `app/static/uploads/avatars/` → `/data/uploads/avatars/` |
| **Persistence** | ❌ Lost on update → ✅ Persists across updates |
| **Docker Volume** | Uses existing `app_data` volume |
| **URL Structure** | `/uploads/avatars/{filename}` (unchanged) |

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/routes/auth.py` - Updated upload folder path
2. ✅ `app/models/user.py` - Updated avatar path method
3. ✅ `docker/migrate-avatar-storage.py` - New migration script
4. ✅ `docs/AVATAR_STORAGE_MIGRATION.md` - Full migration guide

## Verification

Test that avatars work correctly:

1. ✅ Existing avatars display correctly
2. ✅ New avatar uploads work
3. ✅ Avatar removal works
4. ✅ Avatars persist after `docker-compose down && docker-compose up`
