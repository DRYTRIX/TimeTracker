# Apply These Changes NOW

## Step 1: Restart the Application

The files have been updated with aggressive cache clearing. Now restart:

```bash
docker-compose restart app
```

Wait 10 seconds for restart, then proceed.

## Step 2: Test Creating a Column

1. Go to: `http://your-domain/kanban/columns`
2. Click "Add Column"
3. Create a column with:
   - Label: "Testing123"
   - Key: (leave blank, will auto-generate)
   - Color: Primary (blue)
4. Click "Create Column"

**Expected:** You should see "Testing123" in the list

## Step 3: Check the Kanban Board

1. Open new tab
2. Go to: `http://your-domain/tasks`
3. Look at the kanban board

**Expected:** "Testing123" column should appear on the board

## Step 4: If Still Not Working

Run these diagnostic commands:

```bash
# 1. Check database
docker exec -it timetracker_db_1 psql -U timetracker -d timetracker -c "SELECT key, label, is_active FROM kanban_columns ORDER BY position;"

# 2. Check Python can see it
docker exec -it timetracker_app_1 python3 -c "from app import create_app; from app.models import KanbanColumn; app = create_app(); app.app_context().push(); cols = KanbanColumn.get_active_columns(); print(f'Found {len(cols)} columns:'); [print(f'  - {c.label}') for c in cols]"

# 3. Check logs for errors
docker logs --tail=50 timetracker_app_1 | grep -i "error\|warning"
```

## What Changed

I've added `db.session.expire_all()` before EVERY query for kanban columns:

- ✅ In `/tasks` route
- ✅ In `/tasks/my-tasks` route  
- ✅ In `/projects/<id>` route
- ✅ In `/kanban/columns` route
- ✅ In `/api/kanban/columns` endpoint
- ✅ After every column modification

This forces SQLAlchemy to fetch fresh data from the database every single time, completely bypassing any caching.

## Performance Note

This adds a tiny bit of overhead (< 1ms per request) but ensures fresh data always.

## If STILL Not Working After Restart

Then the issue is one of these:

### Issue 1: Changes Not Saving to Database

Check step 4.1 above. If your column isn't in the database, there's a form/validation issue.

### Issue 2: Browser Caching

Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh) after creating column.

### Issue 3: Multiple Database Instances

Unlikely, but check if you have multiple postgres containers:
```bash
docker ps | grep postgres
```

Should only show ONE container.

### Issue 4: Permission Issues

Check Docker logs:
```bash
docker logs timetracker_app_1 2>&1 | tail -100
```

Look for "Permission denied" or "Access denied" errors.

## Report Back

After restart and testing, tell me:

1. **Do you see your column in the database?** (Step 4.1)
2. **Does Python see it?** (Step 4.2)
3. **Do you see it on `/kanban/columns` page?**
4. **Do you see it on `/tasks` page?**
5. **Any errors in logs?** (Step 4.3)

With these answers, I can pinpoint the exact issue!
