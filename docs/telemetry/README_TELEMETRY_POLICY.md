# Telemetry Policy for TimeTracker

## Quick Summary

- üîí **Telemetry is OPT-IN** (disabled by default)
- üéØ **Analytics keys are embedded** (for consistency across all installations)
- ‚úÖ **You control it** (enable/disable anytime in admin dashboard)
- ‚ùå **No PII collected** (ever)
- üìñ **Fully transparent** (open source, documented)

## Policy Statement

TimeTracker includes embedded analytics configuration to gather anonymous usage insights that help improve the product. However, **all data collection is strictly opt-in and disabled by default**.

## How It Works

### 1. Build Configuration

Analytics keys (PostHog, Sentry) are embedded during the build process:
- **All builds** (including self-hosted) have the same keys
- Keys cannot be overridden via environment variables
- This ensures consistent telemetry for accurate insights

### 2. User Control

Despite embedded keys, **you have complete control**:

#### Default State
- ‚úÖ Telemetry is **DISABLED** by default
- ‚úÖ No data is sent unless you explicitly enable it
- ‚úÖ You are asked during first-time setup

#### Enabling Telemetry
- You must check a box during setup, OR
- You must toggle it on in Admin ‚Üí Telemetry Dashboard

#### Disabling Telemetry
- Uncheck during setup, OR
- Toggle off in Admin ‚Üí Telemetry Dashboard
- Takes effect immediately

### 3. What We Collect

Only if you enable telemetry:

```
‚úÖ Event types: "timer.started", "project.created"
‚úÖ Numeric IDs: user_id=5, project_id=42
‚úÖ Timestamps: When events occurred
‚úÖ Platform info: OS, Python version, app version
‚úÖ Anonymous fingerprint: Hashed installation ID

‚ùå NO usernames, emails, or real names
‚ùå NO project names or descriptions
‚ùå NO time entry content or notes
‚ùå NO client data or business information
‚ùå NO IP addresses
‚ùå NO personally identifiable information
```

## Rationale

### Why Embed Keys?

**Goal:** Understand how TimeTracker is used across all installations to:
1. Prioritize feature development
2. Identify and fix bugs
3. Understand usage patterns
4. Improve user experience

**Why not configurable:**
- Ensures consistent data across all installations
- Prevents fragmented analytics
- Enables accurate community insights
- Still respects privacy through opt-in

### Why This Is Privacy-Respecting

1. **Opt-in by default**: No data sent unless you explicitly enable it
2. **No PII**: We only collect anonymous event types and numeric IDs
3. **User control**: Toggle on/off anytime
4. **Transparent**: All events documented, code is open source
5. **GDPR compliant**: Consent-based, minimization, user rights

## Comparison with Other Software

| Software | Telemetry | User Control | PII Collection |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **TimeTracker** | Opt-in (disabled by default) | Full control via toggle | Never |
| VS Code | Opt-out (enabled by default) | Can disable in settings | Minimal |
| Firefox | Opt-out (enabled by default) | Can disable in settings | Minimal |
| Chrome | Enabled by default | Can disable in settings | Some |
| Ubuntu | Opt-in during install | Can disable | Minimal |

**TimeTracker is MORE privacy-respecting than most mainstream software.**

## Technical Implementation

### Code Locations

All telemetry code is open source and auditable:

```
app/config/analytics_defaults.py  # Configuration (keys embedded here)
app/utils/telemetry.py            # Telemetry logic
app/routes/*.py                   # Event tracking calls
.github/workflows/                # Build process
docs/all_tracked_events.md       # Complete event list
```

### Verification

You can verify what's sent:

```bash
# Check local logs
tail -f logs/app.jsonl | grep event_type

# Inspect network traffic
# Use browser dev tools ‚Üí Network tab

# Review tracked events
cat docs/all_tracked_events.md
```

### How Opt-Out Works

```python
# In app/utils/telemetry.py
def is_telemetry_enabled():
    # Checks user preference from installation config
    return installation_config.get_telemetry_preference()

# In tracking code
def track_event(user_id, event_name, properties):
    if not is_telemetry_enabled():
        return  # Stop immediately - no data sent
    
    # Only reached if user opted in
    posthog.capture(...)
```

## Your Rights

### 1. Right to Disable
Toggle telemetry off anytime in Admin ‚Üí Telemetry Dashboard.

### 2. Right to Know
All tracked events are documented in `docs/all_tracked_events.md`.

### 3. Right to Audit
Code is open source - review `app/utils/telemetry.py` and route files.

### 4. Right to Verify
Check `logs/app.jsonl` to see what would be sent.

### 5. Right to Data Deletion
Contact us to request deletion (though data is anonymized and cannot be linked to you).

## FAQ

### Q: Why can't I use my own PostHog/Sentry keys?

**A:** To ensure consistent telemetry across all installations. However, you can disable telemetry entirely for complete privacy.

### Q: Is this spyware?

**A:** No. Spyware collects data without consent or knowledge. TimeTracker:
- Requires explicit opt-in
- Is disabled by default
- Collects no PII
- Is fully transparent (open source)

### Q: What if I want zero telemetry?

**A:** Keep telemetry disabled (the default). Zero data will be sent.

### Q: Can you identify me from the data?

**A:** No. We only collect anonymous event types and numeric IDs. We cannot link data to specific users or installations.

### Q: What about Sentry error reports?

**A:** Sentry error monitoring follows the same opt-in rules as PostHog. Disabled by default.

### Q: Can I build without embedded keys?

**A:** The keys are embedded during the build process. However, they're only used if you opt in. With telemetry disabled, the keys are present but unused.

### Q: Is this GDPR compliant?

**A:** Yes:
- ‚úÖ Consent-based (opt-in)
- ‚úÖ Data minimization (no PII)
- ‚úÖ Right to withdraw (disable anytime)
- ‚úÖ Transparency (documented)

## Data Retention

- **PostHog:** 7 years (industry standard for analytics)
- **Sentry:** 90 days (error logs)
- **Local logs:** Rotated daily, kept 30 days
