## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Logo Not Appearing**
- Check if the logo file was uploaded successfully
- Verify the file format is supported
- Ensure the file size is under 5MB
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### **Upload Fails**
- Verify you have administrator privileges
- Check file format and size requirements
- Ensure the uploads directory has write permissions
- Check application logs for server-side errors

#### **Migration Issues**
- Ensure the company branding migration ran first
- Check database connection and permissions
- Verify the settings table exists
- Run the migration script with proper database credentials

### **File Permission Issues**

If you encounter permission problems:

```bash
# Set proper permissions on uploads directory
chmod -R 755 app/static/uploads/
chown -R www-data:www-data app/static/uploads/  # Adjust user/group as needed
```

### **Database Connection Issues**

Ensure your database connection is working:

```bash
# Test database connection
python -c "from app import create_app; app = create_app(); print('Database connection OK')"
```

## Security Considerations

### **File Validation**
- **Type Checking**: Only image files are allowed
- **Size Limits**: Maximum 5MB file size
- **Extension Validation**: Strict file extension checking
- **Content Verification**: File content is validated

### **Access Control**
- **Admin Only**: Logo upload requires administrator privileges
- **Authenticated Users**: Logo viewing requires user authentication
- **Session Management**: Proper session handling for uploads

### **File Storage**
- **Isolated Directory**: Logos stored in dedicated uploads folder
- **Unique Naming**: Files renamed to prevent conflicts
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old files removed when replaced

## Performance Optimization

### **Image Optimization**
