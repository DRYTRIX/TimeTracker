## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized development)
- Git

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker.git
   cd TimeTracker
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your development settings
   ```

5. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Docker Development

1. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository and clone your fork locally
2. **Create Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes following the coding standards
4. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass and add new tests for new functionality
5. **Commit**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
6. **Push**: Push your branch to your fork
7. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request with a clear description

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(timer): add automatic idle detection`
- `fix(auth): resolve session timeout issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## Coding Standards

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (use Black formatter)

### Flask

- Keep route handlers thin, move business logic to models or services
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error handling

### Database

- Write migrations for schema changes
- Use proper indexing for performance
- Follow naming conventions for tables and columns

### Frontend

- Use semantic HTML
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Keep CSS organized and maintainable
- Use HTMX for dynamic interactions

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=app

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_timer.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Use fixtures for common test data

### Test Structure

```
