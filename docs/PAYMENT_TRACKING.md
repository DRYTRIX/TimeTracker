## Database Schema

### Payments Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    invoice_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES invoices(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    amount NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(3),
    payment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    method VARCHAR(50),
    reference VARCHAR(100),
    notes TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'completed',
    received_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    gateway_transaction_id VARCHAR(255),
    gateway_fee NUMERIC(10, 2),
    net_amount NUMERIC(10, 2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX ix_payments_invoice_id ON payments(invoice_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_payments_payment_date ON payments(payment_date);
CREATE INDEX ix_payments_status ON payments(status);
CREATE INDEX ix_payments_received_by ON payments(received_by);
```

## Migration

The payment tracking feature includes an Alembic migration (`035_enhance_payments_table.py`) that:

1. Creates the payments table if it doesn't exist
2. Adds enhanced tracking fields (status, received_by, gateway fields)
3. Creates necessary indexes for performance
4. Sets up foreign key relationships

To apply the migration:

```bash
# Using Alembic
alembic upgrade head

# Or using Flask-Migrate
flask db upgrade
```

## Best Practices

### Recording Payments

1. **Record payments promptly**: Keep payment records up-to-date
2. **Use reference numbers**: Always include transaction IDs or check numbers
3. **Document gateway fees**: Record processing fees for accurate accounting
4. **Add notes**: Include any relevant context or special circumstances
5. **Verify amounts**: Double-check payment amounts match actual receipts

### Payment Status Management

1. **Pending payments**: Use for payments awaiting clearance
2. **Failed payments**: Record failed attempts for tracking
3. **Refunds**: Use refunded status and create negative payments if needed
4. **Partial payments**: Record each payment separately for clear audit trail

### Security and Permissions

1. Regular users can only manage payments for their own invoices
2. Admins can manage all payments
3. Payment deletion adjusts invoice status automatically
4. All payment actions are logged with user information

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Updating Invoice Status

- Ensure payment status is set to "completed"
- Verify invoice ID is correct
- Check that payment amount is valid
- Refresh the invoice page to see updates

### Gateway Fee Not Calculating

- Ensure gateway fee field is populated
- Payment model automatically calculates net amount
- Call `calculate_net_amount()` method if needed

### Missing Payment Methods

- Payment methods can be customized in the route handler
- Add new methods to the dropdown in create/edit templates
- Methods are stored as strings in the database

## Testing

The payment tracking feature includes comprehensive tests:

### Unit Tests (`tests/test_payment_model.py`)
- Payment model creation and validation
- Net amount calculation
- Payment-invoice relationships
- Payment-user relationships
- Multiple payments per invoice
- Status handling

### Route Tests (`tests/test_payment_routes.py`)
- All CRUD operations
- Access control and permissions
- Filtering and searching
- Invalid input handling
- Payment statistics API

### Smoke Tests (`tests/test_payment_smoke.py`)
- Basic functionality verification
- Template existence
- Database schema
- End-to-end workflow
- Integration with invoices

Run tests with:

```bash
# All payment tests
pytest tests/test_payment*.py

# Specific test file
pytest tests/test_payment_model.py -v

# Smoke tests only
pytest tests/test_payment_smoke.py -v
```
