# Command Palette Usage Guide

## Overview

The TimeTracker command palette is a powerful keyboard-driven interface that allows you to quickly navigate and execute commands without using the mouse. It's inspired by similar features in modern applications like VS Code, Sublime Text, and GitHub.

## Opening the Command Palette

You can open the command palette in multiple ways:

### Primary Method
- **Press `?` (question mark key)** - Simply press the `?` key anywhere in the application
  - Quick, easy to remember
  - Doesn't require modifier keys
  - Works on all keyboard layouts

### Alternative Methods
- **Press `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux)** or **`Cmd+K` (Mac)** - Traditional power user shortcut
- **Click the command palette button** in the navigation bar (terminal icon)
- **Use the help menu** dropdown

## Using the Command Palette

Once opened, you can:

1. **Type to search** - Start typing to filter available commands
2. **Navigate** - Use arrow keys (↑/↓) to move between commands
3. **Execute** - Press `Enter` to run the selected command or click on it
4. **Cancel** - Press `Esc` or click outside the palette to close

## Available Commands

Type the first letter, then the second letter in quick succession (within 1 second).
