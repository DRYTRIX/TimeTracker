# Bulk Operations and Status Management Implementation

## Summary

This document describes the bulk operations functionality added to the TimeTracker application for projects, tasks, and clients, along with the inactive status support for projects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Bulk Selectors for All Entities

**Implementation Pattern:**
- Checkbox in table header to select all items
- Individual checkboxes for each row
- Bulk Actions dropdown button that appears when items are selected
- Consistent UI pattern across Tasks, Projects, and Clients

**Features:**
- Select All checkbox with indeterminate state support
- Real-time counter showing number of selected items
- Bulk Actions dropdown menu with multiple options
- Individual delete buttons remain available in each row

### 2. Bulk Operations Available

#### Tasks
- **Bulk Delete**: Delete multiple tasks at once
  - Skips tasks with time entries
  - Shows summary of deletions and skips

#### Projects
- **Mark as Active**: Bulk activate multiple projects
- **Mark as Inactive**: Bulk deactivate multiple projects
- **Archive**: Bulk archive multiple projects
- **Bulk Delete**: Delete multiple projects at once
  - Skips projects with time entries
  - Shows summary of deletions and skips

#### Clients
- **Mark as Active**: Bulk activate multiple clients
- **Mark as Inactive**: Bulk deactivate multiple clients
- **Bulk Delete**: Delete multiple clients at once
  - Skips clients with projects
  - Shows summary of deletions and skips

### 3. Project Inactive Status

**New Status:**
- Projects now support three statuses: `active`, `inactive`, `archived`
- Inactive allows temporary pausing without archiving
- Visual indicator with warning/yellow color

**Status Transitions:**
- Active ↔ Inactive ↔ Archived
- Individual and bulk status changes supported

**Database:**
- No migration needed - existing VARCHAR column supports all values
- Backward compatible with existing data

### 4. User Interface

**Bulk Actions Dropdown Menu:**
```
┌─ Bulk Actions (X) ─────────────┐
│ ✓ Mark as Active                │
│ ⏸ Mark as Inactive              │
│ 📦 Archive (Projects only)      │
│ ─────────────────────────────   │
│ 🗑 Delete                        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Visual Design:**
- Dropdown appears only when items are selected
- Clear iconography for each action
- Confirmation modals for all bulk operations
- Informative success/warning messages

### 5. Routes Added

**Projects:**
- `POST /projects/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple projects
- `POST /projects/bulk-status-change` - Change status for multiple projects
- `POST /projects/<id>/deactivate` - Mark single project as inactive
- `POST /projects/<id>/activate` - Activate single project

**Clients:**
- `POST /clients/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple clients
- `POST /clients/bulk-status-change` - Change status for multiple clients

**Tasks:**
- Existing `POST /tasks/bulk-delete` retained and enhanced

### 6. Files Modified

**Templates:**
- `app/templates/tasks/list.html` - Restored bulk selectors, added individual delete buttons
- `templates/projects/list.html` - Added bulk selectors and status change dropdown
- `templates/clients/list.html` - Added bulk selectors and status change dropdown

**Routes:**
- `app/routes/projects.py` - Added bulk operations and inactive status routes
- `app/routes/clients.py` - Added bulk operations routes
- `app/routes/tasks.py` - Existing bulk delete retained

**Models:**
- `app/models/project.py` - Added `deactivate()` and `activate()` methods

## JavaScript Implementation

### Key Functions

**Common Pattern (used in all three entities):**

```javascript
// Toggle all checkboxes
function toggleAllItems() {
    const selectAll = document.getElementById('selectAll');
    const checkboxes = document.querySelectorAll('.item-checkbox');
    checkboxes.forEach(cb => cb.checked = selectAll.checked);
    updateBulkActionButton();
}

// Update button visibility and count
function updateBulkActionButton() {
    const count = document.querySelectorAll('.item-checkbox:checked').length;
    const btnGroup = document.getElementById('bulkActionsGroup');
    
    if (count > 0) {
        btnGroup.style.display = 'inline-block';
        document.getElementById('selectedCount').textContent = count;
    } else {
        btnGroup.style.display = 'none';
    }
}

// Show confirmation modal for status change
function showBulkStatusChange(newStatus) {
    // Build confirmation message
    // Show modal
    // Store new status
}

// Submit bulk status change
function submitBulkStatusChange() {
    // Collect selected IDs
    // Add to form
    // Submit
}
```

### Confirmation Modals

**Two types of modals:**
1. **Bulk Delete** - Warning about permanent deletion
2. **Bulk Status Change** - Confirmation of status change

Both use Bootstrap modals with proper CSRF token handling.

## Safety Features

### 1. Permission Checks
- All bulk operations require admin privileges
- Individual operations respect existing permissions

### 2. Dependency Validation
- Projects with time entries cannot be deleted
- Clients with projects cannot be deleted
- Tasks with time entries cannot be deleted

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of partial failures
- Detailed error messages for skipped items
- Transaction safety with rollback support

### 4. User Feedback
- Success messages show count of affected items
- Warning messages list skipped items (first 3)
- Info messages when no changes made

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Bulk Activate Projects

1. Navigate to Projects list
2. Check boxes next to inactive projects
3. Click "Bulk Actions" dropdown
4. Select "Mark as Active"
5. Confirm in modal
6. See success message

### Example 2: Bulk Delete Clients

1. Navigate to Clients list
2. Check boxes next to clients without projects
3. Click "Bulk Actions" dropdown
4. Select "Delete"
5. Confirm in modal
6. See summary of deletions and skips

### Example 3: Archive Multiple Projects

1. Navigate to Projects list
2. Check boxes next to completed projects
3. Click "Bulk Actions" dropdown
4. Select "Archive"
5. Confirm in modal
6. Projects moved to archived status

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Bulk Selection:**
- [ ] Select All checkbox selects all visible items
- [ ] Individual checkboxes work correctly
- [ ] Counter updates accurately
- [ ] Bulk Actions button appears/disappears correctly

**Bulk Operations:**
- [ ] Bulk delete works and skips items with dependencies
- [ ] Bulk status change updates all selected items
- [ ] Confirmation modals appear correctly
- [ ] Error messages show for partial failures
- [ ] Success messages show correct counts

**Individual Operations:**
- [ ] Individual delete buttons still work
- [ ] Individual status change buttons still work
- [ ] Permissions are respected

### Automated Tests

Tests should cover:
- Bulk delete with dependencies (should skip)
- Bulk status change (should update all)
- Permission checks (non-admin cannot bulk operate)
- Empty selection handling
- Mixed selection (some deletable, some not)

## Performance Considerations

**Optimizations:**
- Single database commit for all bulk operations
- Efficient query patterns
- Client-side filtering remains fast
- No N+1 query issues

**Scalability:**
- Bulk operations handle large selections efficiently
- Transaction safety maintained
- Memory usage optimized

## Security

**CSRF Protection:**
- All forms include CSRF tokens
- Token validation on server side

**Authorization:**
- Admin-only bulk operations
- Individual operation permissions respected
- Audit logging for all changes

## Internationalization

**Translation Support:**
- All UI strings are translatable
- Confirmation messages support i18n
- Status labels properly localized

**New Translation Keys:**
```
- "Bulk Actions"
- "Mark as Active"
- "Mark as Inactive"  
- "Archive"
- "Delete Selected"
- "Change Status"
- "Are you sure you want to mark {count} {entity}(s) as {status}?"
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Export selected items** to CSV
2. **Bulk edit** for other fields
3. **Saved selections** for repeated operations
4. **Scheduled bulk operations**
5. **Bulk operations history/audit log**
6. **Undo bulk operations** (with time limit)
7. **Keyboard shortcuts** for bulk actions
8. **Drag and drop** for bulk operations

## Backward Compatibility
