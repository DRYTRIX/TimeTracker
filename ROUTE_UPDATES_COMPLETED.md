# Multi-Tenant Route Updates - Status

## ✅ Completed Updates

### 1. Projects Routes (`app/routes/projects.py`) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Added tenancy imports
- ✅ Added `@require_organization_access()` decorators to all routes
- ✅ Replaced `Project.query` with `scoped_query(Project)`
- ✅ Replaced `Client.query` with `scoped_query(Client)`
- ✅ Added `organization_id` parameter to Project creation
- ✅ Verified client belongs to same organization
- ✅ Updated unique name checks to be per-organization

### 2. Organizations Routes (`app/routes/organizations.py`) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Fully implemented with multi-tenant support
- ✅ Organization CRUD operations
- ✅ Member management
- ✅ API endpoints

## ⏳ Remaining Updates Needed

The following routes still need to be updated with the same patterns:

### High Priority (Update Next)
1. **`app/routes/clients.py`**
   - Add tenancy imports
   - Add `@require_organization_access()` decorators
   - Use `scoped_query(Client)`
   - Add `organization_id` to Client creation
   - Update unique name check to be per-organization

2. **`app/routes/timer.py`**
   - Add tenancy imports
   - Add `@require_organization_access()` decorators
   - Use `scoped_query(TimeEntry)` and `scoped_query(Project)`
   - Add `organization_id` to TimeEntry creation
   - Verify project belongs to same organization

3. **`app/routes/tasks.py`**
   - Add tenancy imports
   - Add `@require_organization_access()` decorators
   - Use `scoped_query(Task)` and `scoped_query(Project)`
   - Add `organization_id` to Task creation
   - Verify project belongs to same organization

### Medium Priority
4. **`app/routes/invoices.py`**
5. **`app/routes/comments.py`**
6. **`app/routes/reports.py`**

### Low Priority
7. **`app/routes/analytics.py`**
8. **`app/routes/api.py`** (if not already covered)
9. **`app/routes/admin.py`** (may need special handling)

## Update Pattern

For each route file, apply this pattern:

### Step 1: Add Imports
```python
from app.utils.tenancy import (
    get_current_organization_id,
    scoped_query,
    require_organization_access
)
```

### Step 2: Add Decorator
```python
@some_bp.route('/path')
@login_required
@require_organization_access()  # Add this
def my_route():
    ...
```

### Step 3: Use Scoped Queries
```python
# Before:
items = Model.query.filter_by(status='active').all()

# After:
items = scoped_query(Model).filter_by(status='active').all()
```

### Step 4: Add organization_id to Creates
```python
# Before:
new_item = Model(name='...', ...)

# After:
org_id = get_current_organization_id()
new_item = Model(name='...', organization_id=org_id, ...)
```

### Step 5: Verify Cross-References
```python
# When referencing related models, verify they're in same org:
project = scoped_query(Project).filter_by(id=project_id).first_or_404()
```

## Quick Application Guide

The migration is **intentionally gradual**. The infrastructure is complete and will work with partially-updated routes. You can:

1. **Update one file at a time** and test
2. **Follow the priority order** (high → medium → low)
3. **Test after each update** to ensure correctness

The application will continue to work even with some routes not yet updated (they just won't have organization scoping yet).

## Status Summary

- **Infrastructure**: 100% Complete ✅
- **Core Models**: 100% Complete ✅  
- **Route Updates**: ~15% Complete (2 of ~12 files)
- **Testing**: Ready to use ✅
- **Documentation**: Complete ✅

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining high-priority routes (clients, timer, tasks)
2. Test with multiple organizations
3. Update medium-priority routes
4. Final testing and verification

See `docs/ROUTE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed patterns and examples.
